## Syntax Example


```family
Potter

James + Lily Evans =
Harry


Weasley

Arthur + Molly? =
Fred
George
Ronald
girl?

Fred and George - twins

Ronald and Harry Potter - best friends
```

In this example question marks after names shows that we don't remember maiden name of Molly and don't remember name of last child, only that it's a girl. Last two line shows relation between Fred and George, Ronald and Harry
